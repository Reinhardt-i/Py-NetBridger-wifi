# Exposing Your Chat App with ngrok

You can use ngrok to expose your chat application to the internet, allowing others to connect to it even if they are not on the same local network as your server. Follow these steps to use ngrok with your chat app:

1. **Install ngrok:**
   - Download and install ngrok from the [official website](https://ngrok.com/download).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Run Your Chat Server:**
   - Ensure your chat server is up and running on your local machine. Your server code should be running and listening for incoming connections.

3. **Expose Your Server with ngrok:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you installed ngrok.
   - Run the following command to expose your chat server on a public URL, replacing `12345` with the port your server is listening on:

     ```bash
     ngrok tcp 12345
     ```

   - ngrok will generate a public URL (e.g., `tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`) that you can share with others. This URL will point to your local chat server.

4. **Share the ngrok URL:**
   - Share the generated ngrok URL with the people you want to chat with. They can use this URL to connect to your chat server from anywhere.

5. **Connect Clients to the ngrok URL:**
   - In your client code, replace the server address with the ngrok URL. For example:

     ```python
     server_address = ('0.tcp.ngrok.io', 12345)  # Replace with the ngrok URL and port
     ```

   - Run your client code, and it should now connect to your chat server via ngrok.

6. **Chat Over the Internet:**
   - With your server exposed via ngrok, clients from anywhere in the world can connect to your chat application using the ngrok URL and chat with you over the internet.

Keep in mind that ngrok generates a dynamic subdomain for your tunnel, so the URL may change each time you restart ngrok. If you want a more stable URL, you can consider upgrading to a paid ngrok plan that offers custom domains.

Remember to keep your server and ngrok running as long as you want others to have access to your chat application. When you're done, you can stop ngrok to close the tunnel.
